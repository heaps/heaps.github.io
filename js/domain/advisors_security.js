    title       : 'Devi Narayan, MIT GDC Advisory Board Member',
    description : '<div><p>Devi is CEO of Autnhive Inc a cyber security company based in Canada and the US. Devi’s expertise in cybersecurity extends beyond the corporate realm into education and public speaking. He has shared his extensive knowledge and insights on cybersecurity through lectures at various prestigious venues, including conferences, industry events, law enforcement training sessions, and Universities. His engagements cover a wide range of topics in the field, aiming to educate and inspire professionals across different sectors on the importance and intricacies of cybersecurity. This aspect of his career highlights his commitment to fostering a broader understanding and development of cybersecurity practices, further establishing him as a thought leader in the industry. His relentless perseverance and journey from dental clinics to police stations, and ultimately to the executive suite, is not only inspirational but also a tremendous asset to his company as they navigate the intricate world of cybersecurity and technology. Initially trained as a dentist, Devi contributed numerous research papers published in American Periodontal Association Journals. However, he chose to leave the field to pursue broader ambitions, armed with little more than a few hundred dollars and a drive to succeed on his own merits. Devi received further education and certifications from California State University – Sacramento and the California Department of Justice in Intelligence and Crime Analysis, as well as Major Financial Crime Investigation from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Major Crimes Investigator and many more. These experiences honed his skills in extracting actionable intelligence from disparate data, a skill he applies effectively while leading a team of Business Intelligence experts.</p></div>',

Wagner commands the North East Information Operations Center (NEIOC), a Battalion Command within the Army Reserve Information Operations Command, at Ft Devens, MA.<br><br> The NEIOC trains soldiers to support Joint and Army units in cybersecurity operations. The unit is unique because many of the soldiers possess civilian-acquired skills, which enable them to provide a high level of support to units that are difficult to attain within the active component. Prior to selection for command, Lt. Col. Wagner served as a Computer Network Operations planner with USSTRATCOM. He has twice been awarded the Bronze Star Medal while supporting Operations Desert Storm and Iraqi Freedom. He holds a BA in economics from the Virginia Military Institute and a MA in economics from the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. He is a graduate of the Command and General Staff Officers Course.<br><br> In his civilian employment, he is a Project and Department Manager for Northrop Grumman. He is the technical lead on the 1st Information Operations Command support contract. He is directly responsible for the Incident Response, Network Monitoring, Forensic collection, and Malware Analysis support provided to the command. He is a contributing author to the Basic Computer Network Operations Planner’s course, which qualifies officers for an Army Skill Identifier for CNO planning. He recently published a paper on the use of virtualization in computer security with Dr. Anup Ghosh of George Mason University. The paper was published at the Cyber Infrastructure Protection conference in New York City and was sponsored by the Army War College as well as the City College of New York.</p></div>',
